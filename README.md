# Thumbpocalypse
Here are some of the files from my Thumbpocalypse project.

There are two thumbprints on the screen that need to be pressed simultaneously or the game will pause itself. 
Each thumbprint has a script on it to monitor its state and send the events when it changes.

The game controller script is responsible for starting the game when both thumbs are down.

Once the bomb is instantiated its BombScript handles most of the games logic.

There are a few other scripts in the project but none contain anything very noteworthy.
